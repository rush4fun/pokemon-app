# Pokemon APP
Introduction
---
Please create a simple application with the list of pokemons (pokedex). You can pick either the front-end or the full-stack requirements. Full stack variant is more complex (has more requirements) and will also demonstrate your backend skills.
***
Requirements
---
You have to meet the following requirements:
* Source code should be open sourced in GitHub
* The design of the app is not important, but the overall user experience and usability of the application should be good. You can use the existing UI libraries like material ui or ant.design
* Application should be responsive (look good both on mobile and desktop)
* Code should be linted. Preferably with the eslint standard config (https://github.com/feross/eslint-config-standard)
* The application should be deployed online. Heroku, github pages are a few of free alternatives for deployment
***
Front End Candidate Requirements:
---
* List pokemons in a table view (or cards) with their name, avatar, type (should visually look as a colored tag) and the main pokemon stats (whichever additional pokemon info you want to show)
* The list must have a pagination with an ability to select how many items to show per page (10 / 20 / 50)
* Filter the pokemons by name with a search box
* Filter the pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags have to show pokemons with any of the types selected)
